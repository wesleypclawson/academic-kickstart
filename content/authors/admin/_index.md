Obtained his undergraduate (Bachelor's) in Physics and Electrical Engineering with honors at the University of Arkansas and obtained his Master's in Electrical Engineering at the University of Arkansas. His research during this time was focused on criticality in neural networks as apart of a collaborative project with Washington University in St. Louis, MO. He worked as a cloud architect for Windstream for a brief time before pursing his PhD at Aix-Marseille University as apart of the INS institute.

His research interest is in circuit level neuroscience in memory processes through the lense of complex systems and computation theory. He is funded by the EU ITN program, M-GATE which funds multiple PhD students across Europe to study memory with tools from genetics to computational neuroscience.
